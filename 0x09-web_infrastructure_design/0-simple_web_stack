Explain what the issues are with this infrastructure
1) SPOF (single point of failure):
With this infrastructure, if a device or the sever in the network fails, the whole network would be loss reason being that, there's no standby server incase of an SPOF

2) Downtime when maintenance needed:
With this type of infrastructure, when an update needs to be performed, the whole server needs to be restarted which also has an effect on ther performance of the network

3) Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
Since we only have one server that's recieving incoming traffic, it would be difficult to scale because the resources that the server is providing is limited.
